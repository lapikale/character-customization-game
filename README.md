## Description

In a magical land full of all sorts of mystical creatures, you can be whatever you want!

This project is a character customization game in which you can switch out certain features of the character on screen with the arrows provided! 
You can choose to switch between 3 different options provided for the character's skin tone, head, top, and legs! Exciting!

Included in this repository is the src folder containing the game code, the project proposal text file, and a folder of the images for the character assets, the background image, and the arrows. All images shown in this game were drawn by me using Procreate.

The game uses lists where the images of each individual body part are loaded and iterated through. In the game loop, code was made so that only one image in that particular list is displayed on the screen at a time, and arrows dedicated to each individual body part/image list would be how the player could personally interact with the game and have control over what the displayed character looked like.

I enjoy the character customization aspect of games and would play a lot of Picrew when I was bored, and I wanted to make a game similar to that, but in a simpler format. Originally I was going to do something much simpler, with the game generating a character by randomly choosing between the images to draw onto the screen everytime the program was run, but I wanted to try to make it more interactive and added arrow buttons on the screen that the player could click to easily scroll through the selections.

If I had more time with this project I would've liked to make more drawings for the body parts as well as different parts to customize as well, such as the eyes or accessories. I'm pretty happy with how this came out though!
